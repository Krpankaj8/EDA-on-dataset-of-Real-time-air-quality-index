🏙️ EDA of Air Quality Across Indian Cities
This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of air quality data collected from various cities in India. The analysis focuses on identifying pollution trends, comparing regional differences, and visualizing key metrics to better understand the state of air quality across the country.

📌 Objectives
Analyze air quality data across different Indian cities

Identify key pollutants and their distribution

Fill and handle missing data appropriately

Rename and organize columns for clarity

Visualize trends, patterns, and potential pollution hotspots

📂 Dataset
The dataset used is titled "DATASET.csv", which includes:

City-level air quality metrics

Pollutant minimum, maximum, and average values

Geographic identifiers

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
This analysis is conducted using Python with the help of the following libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

🔍 Analysis Highlights
Imputation of missing values using mean substitution

Renaming of inconsistent columns (e.g., longitude.1 ➝ pollutant)

Initial data inspection and cleaning

Planned visualizations for pollutants over time and across regions

📊 Sample Output
Plots and insights showing:

Average pollution levels city-wise

Comparisons of pollutant concentration

Heatmaps and bar plots for regional differences

📎 Future Improvements
Add interactive visualizations using Plotly

Incorporate time-series analysis if timestamped data is available

Link external air quality indices (e.g., AQI) for better contextual insights
